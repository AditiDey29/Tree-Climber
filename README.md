# Tree Climber
It is a windows based python game, a tree climbing game, where you(blue circle) climb some trees and prevent getting hurt from monkeys(yellow squares) coming down.
If a monkey is coming down the tree you are in, press the left and right arrows to change the tree.
As you keep moving up, the score and speed increases.

# Libraries Required
For this we only need to install only the pygame library of python using the PIP command.
Other modules used are sys and random.
