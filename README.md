# Tree Climber
 It is a tree climbing game, where you(blue circle) climb some trees and prevent getting hurt from monkeys(yellow squares) coming down.
 If a monkey is coming down the tree you are in, press the left and right arrows to change the tree.
 As you keep moving up, the score and speed increases.
for this we only need the pygame library of python.

I have borrowed most of the code from https://youtu.be/-8n91btt5d8
